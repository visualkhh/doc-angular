# Bookshelf

- This is the final project for the [CodeCraft Angular Course](https://ng2.codecraft.tv/) 
- In this project you will create an Angular CLI powered SPA, consuming the Google Books API, implementing search, pagination as well as saving favorite books to local storage.
- Before you start this project make sure you have either gone through the official 
[CodeCraft Angular Course or Book](https://ng2.codecraft.tv/) - it's *FREE* - or are comfortable with the material and sections in that course already.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository and clone it onto your computer.
2. Checkout the master branch and use that as the starting point.
3. Follow the instructions in [this video]() - this explains what I need you to create, where you are starting from and what the expectations are of the completed application.
4. If you feel confident you can go ahead and attempt to complete the project yourself with no further hints.
5. If you are stuck or want to validate your work as you go along then i've broken down the project into 8 steps with completed code, hints and code walkthroughs. 

## Code Reviews

For *workshop participants only* you can also submit a pull request of your completed code for review and feedback. 

Instructions on how to submit a pull request can be found in this [video](https://vimeo.com/200501735/ad26e323b1).

## Steps

Each step has:-

- A video which explains what to build for that step.
- A branch with the completed code for that step, which you can compare against your own attempt.
- A video walk-through of me completing that step, which you can watch if you are stuck or if you want to validate the work you've done before you move to the next step.
